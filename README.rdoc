Weather-ly

Senior Project for CSU Chico Spring 2013

This website is built on Rails 3.2.9 using wundergrounds weather api. 


Things left to implement:
  Validation on reports:
    Reports need custom validation because of form_tag and tableless models
  User Favorites:
    Save cities user looks up so they don't have to search every time
  CSS:
    Works and is fluid but could look a lot cleaner
  Always adding more functionality
